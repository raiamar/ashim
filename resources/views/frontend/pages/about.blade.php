We sell fashion with protection ensuring quality and with the promise of reliability. But above all, one thing we prioritize in selling is “Road Safety”.

          Our Story
A story of many firsts and every one of them was a blessing.
Helmets Nepal began operation in Kathmandu in 2016 as the first complete online one-click online platform in Nepal with a store in Anamnagar. The same year, we became the first motorcycle safety gear and accessories retail store in the industry to introduce the concept of showrooms in Nepal by opening our first one in Maitighar. Another showroom followed in Teku, next to our corporate office in 2019.
          </h5>
          <br>
          <h5 class="text-center">
          In early 2021, we opened our third showroom in Nagpokhari.
Now Helmets Nepal is the go-to platform and place for safety gears ranging from varieties of helmets, safety apparel lubricants and, riding techs.
